# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course project work 

This readme describes how run_analysis.r works and creates a tidy data set.

The first step is to download the .zip file containing the raw data from the following URL:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Unzip this file to your working directory.

Open run_analysis.r in RStudio and run it. 

The script will generate a folder in your working directory called "Cleaned_Data" where the cleaned data files will be placed.
The two files are the following:
merged_cleaned_data.txt (7,95 MB) - it contains the cleaned data set.
data_averages.txt (218 KB) - it containes the averaged data of each variable for each activity and each subject.
