@ Getting and cleaning data course project work code book

This file describes all the variables, the data, and transformations what I have done to clean up the given raw data.

Source of the original data:

Data set provided for the project:

1. step:
It reads X_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt and subject_test.txt data and merges them 
to three data sets.

2. step:
It extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Using features.txt, the proper are
selected and furthermore, the variable names are cleaned to make them easier to read.

3. step:
Descriptive activity names are used to name the activities in the data set. Using activity_labels.txt, the activities are named properly.

4. step:
The data set is appropriately labelled with descriptive activity names. The merged three data sets are combined and written out
to a generated "Cleaned_Data" folder under the name of "merged_cleaned_data.txt".

5. step:
A 2nd independent tidy data set is created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. It is and written out
to a generated "Cleaned_Data" folder under the name of "data_averages.txt".
